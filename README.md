I am using intelij IDE
I Excluded post mapping "/api/supplier/query" End point from CORS as postmaping is giving 401 Unauthorized issue. and i wanted to implememnt spring security with jwt and Oauth, Unfortunately not able to to that my IDE is giving some trouble to JWT in pom file
I have added custom exception.
we can use @valid in requestParams to validate the request 
In model class also we can add @NotNull with a message on the variables location,natureOfBusiness,manufacturingProcess so that they cant be null 
we can also use optional keyword to gracefully handle Null in the code.
